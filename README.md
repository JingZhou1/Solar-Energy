# Solar Energy Analysis
The objective of this project is to develop and analyze a simulation model of solar power generation and electricity costs.

## 1. Develop predictive models from data

## 2. Design and implementing a relatively complex simulation model

## 3. Conduct analysis of your model to identify prescriptions
